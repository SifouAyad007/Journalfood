# Food Journal App

A mobile application built with React Native that allows users to visually and descriptively document their daily meals. Users can capture or select meal photos, add descriptions, categorize entries (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks), and manage their food journals with editing, filtering, and swipe-to-delete features.
Features

    Add Food Journals: Take a photo with the camera or select one from the gallery, add a description, and categorize your meal.

    Edit & Delete Entries: Update or remove journal entries with intuitive swipe actions.

    Category Filtering: View all entries or filter by meal category.

    Local Storage: All data is stored locally using SQLite for privacy and offline access.

    User Authentication: Each userâ€™s journals are kept separate.

    Modern UI: Clean, user-friendly interface with responsive design.
